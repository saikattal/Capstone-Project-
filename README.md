# Capstone Project AnomaData(Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance)

## Project Overview
AnomaData is a predictive maintenance solution aimed at reducing risks and providing actionable insights through the processing of equipment data. This project focuses on predicting machine breakdowns by identifying anomalies in the data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, AnomaData evaluates the condition of equipment through online monitoring, allowing for maintenance to be performed before any significant degradation or failure occurs.

## Problem Statement
System failures can occur in any machine, posing significant risks to various industries. Predictive maintenance is essential for preventing such failures and ensuring the continuous operation of equipment. This project aims to predict machine breakdowns by identifying anomalies in the data. The dataset consists of over 18,000 rows collected over a few days, with binary labels in the 'y' column indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of anomalies.
